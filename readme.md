Project goals

Given this was a new dataset that was messy and unclear. My goal was to understand the data first and comprehend what is the purpose of
tables, columns and values are and what I am trying to achieve with the information provide to me and what steps do I need to take to 
understand the data and write queries that are appropriate to explain them from business perspective.

Process and steps

I answered and also brought questions from business standpoint to understand the data. Part 3 and 4 of the project helped me to approach each question.
for example I tried avoid data that serve no purpose and do not provide any information to the questions I am trying to answer. I also cleared one specific table to make sense of it if anyone look at it in future so it is more comprehendible and convenient to do queries and perform tasks on it.
Given the dataset, it is difficult to join tables and find appropriate keys or a column values that match, which could result in errors.
However tables all_sessions, products, analytics have common column value types in which allow to join table and write queries. for example,
according to question 4, from part 2, I was able to join productsku from all_sessions table and sku from products table together and get the top selling product for each and country. I also made assumption where the question is asking about "top-selling product" for each city and country because there was no accurate revenue for products to measure by that criteria, I measured the top-selling product by quantity of orders for that products. Although this may not be accurate enough but given the available dataset, this is the most accurate way to measure the top-selling product.


Result

The data provide enough insight for me to make connection between tables and columns to make relatively accurate assumptions and judgements to answer certain questions requested. although making connections between columns were difficult, I was able to connect the tables to each other and get an accurate response..

challenges

I would say making assumptions, figuring out on how to distinguish and connect the tables with right values and columns were challenging. Not to mention that I have provide a business perspective to questions as well.


Future goals
I would like to return to this project in future at my own time to make further changes such as, cleaning the rest of the data, and create more questions 
to able to answer them from business perspective and set goals on what needs to be done. The more I study the data the more I can learn and change things if necessary.
